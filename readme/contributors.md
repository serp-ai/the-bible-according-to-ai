# Contributors

Thanks to all who contribute now & in the future!

If you'd like to contribute please fork the project, work on some passages and submit a pull request.

We are just using the Bible passages pretty much verbatim as prompts for the image generations; and sometimes using the successive passages as prompt continuations via "make variations" on the previously used image to 'continue the narrative'.

Feel free to add flags `-` at the end to get different styling and interpretations if you wish. Include them with your images if you do and think they would be interesting to catalogue.
