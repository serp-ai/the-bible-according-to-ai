# GENESIS 1

¹ In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&#x20;

² The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.&#x20;

³ Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.&#x20;

⁴ And God saw that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness. 5God called the light “day” and the darkness “night.” And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day.
